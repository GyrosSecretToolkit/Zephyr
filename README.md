# Zephyr
A secret hunting tool that utilizes as many apis as possible to find secrets within roblox accounts and games. Along with other stuff. 

(note: you can use the releases instead of compiling, but if you do not trust them you can do it this way)
# HOW TO COMPILE:
1: get golang from the official golang website; https://go.dev/doc/install

2: install fyne; https://docs.fyne.io/started/

3: compile; in the terminal, cd into the Zephyr folder and run: "go build ."
